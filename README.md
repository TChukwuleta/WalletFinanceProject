# WalletFinanceProject

Building a wallet based application to help simplify student finances. Here student can through this platform purchase food from cafe, groceries from stores within
the school either through regular transfer or scanning of barcode. 


Subdivided into three sections: Student and Clients.. Here are the features for each.

Student Features: The students features allows student to send/transfer money to their friends on the platform, it also let student request for money from people on the platform. Students can also pay for their goods in the cafe or store, either by directly transfering funds or scanning the QR code of the merchant.


Client Features: The clients are like the merchant/store owners. As a merchant I can have multiple stores operating individually although under me (more like a virtual system). Stores can easily receive funds from students within and around campuses. The stores can also via the platform, pay for its expenses. 


Still to come:

Bills payment for both students and clients.
Direct school fees payment (somewhat like remita).
